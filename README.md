# Road-Accident-Severity-Prediction
In recent years, Road Accidents (RAs) have emerged as an important public health issue which needs to be tackled by a multi-disciplinary approach. The trend in RA injuries and death is becoming alarming. A road traffic accident can be defined as, an event that occurs on a way or street open to public traffic resulting in one or more persons being injured or killed, where at least one moving vehicle is involved. The important factors are human errors, driver fatigue, poor traffic sense, mechanical fault of vehicle, speeding and overtaking violation of traffic rules, poor road conditions, traffic congestion, road encroachment etc. This analytical project will analyze traffic accidents more deeply to determine the intensity of accidents by using machine learning approaches. It also figures out those significant factors that have a clear effect on road accidents and provide some beneficent suggestions regarding this issue. In this project, we will be using classification methods to predict the severity of the road accidents.
